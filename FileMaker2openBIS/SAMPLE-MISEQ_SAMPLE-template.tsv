# All columns except "identifier" can be removed from the file.
# If a column is removed from the file or a cell in a column is left empty the corresponding values of updated samples will be preserved.
# To delete a value/connection from openBIS one needs to put "--DELETE--"  or \"__DELETE__\" into the corresponding cell
# (in particular, a sample can become detached from an experiment, container or all parents this way).
# Basically the "identifier" column should contain sample identifiers, e.g. /SPACE/SAMPLE_1,
# but for samples from default space (if it was provided in the form) it is enough to put sample codes (e.g. SAMPLE_1) into the column.
# The "container" column (if not removed) should contain sample identifier for the new container of the updated sample, e.g. /SPACE/SAMPLE_1
# The "parent" column (if not removed) should contain comma separated list of sample identifiers, e.g. /SPACE/SAMPLE_1,/SPACE/SAMPLE_2
# The "experiment" column (if not removed) should contain experiment identifier, e.g. /SPACE/PROJECT/EXP_1
# The "default_space" column is optional, it can be used to override home space for the row
# The "current_container" column is optional, it can be used to specify container where the updated sample belongs before the update
